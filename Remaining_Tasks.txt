Remaining Tasks:
Finish Collecting Data on Computer
	Complete Memory Collection

Agenda: 
Limitation of Data Points
  Review the limitation table for time and memory
  Limitations for Rips Complex are based on number of points and feature dimensions
  Alpha Complex seems to be limited to 3D point clouds
  
  Where should we stop the data for each point cloud feature dimension?
  What should be the interval between number of points for each point cloud?
  What do we do about the alpha complexes?
  
Selection of Figures
  Fig 1: Runtimes of all libraries against torus
      This graph is a must
      In general, how to show exponential growth of TDAstats in proper scale
      
  Fig 2: Runtimes of all libraries against n-dim boxes
      This graph is limited by the number of points we can test on my laptop
      
  Fig 3: Runtimes of all libraries against n-dim annuluses
      This graph is limited by the number of points we can test on my laptop
      May be redundant with Fig 2. 
      Replace by holding feat.dim constant and increasing data dimension??
      
  Fig 4: Runtime of all libraries against 4D sphere by n-dim features
      This graph is limited by the number of points we can test on my laptop

  Fig 5: Object size of rips filtration on all point clouds by library
      Seemingly restricted to 3D point clouds due to alpha complex limitation
      
  Fig 6: Exec time of rips Filtration vs alpha complex on all point clouds
      Seemingly restricted to 3D points clouds due to alpha complex limitation

Explaining the theoretical computation times for Rips vs Alpha Complexes
  Discussing O(2^n)?
  Alpha complex time increases with additional dimensions
  Rips complex time increases with additional points

For nonTDA stats, how do we resolve the limiting radius? GUDHI and Dionysus requires fixed radius
  Write code to make it a non fixed number?
  Or give TDAstats a fixed radius to expand to?
  Or keep the radius at 5 which is the default example given in TDA package guide
  
For memory, clarify correct language with regards to boundary matrix and object size
